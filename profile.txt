About Me: Hi! I'm Camille Loon, a regular teenager who loves to explore new things and enjoy life to the fullest. When I'm not busy with schoolwork, you’ll find me hanging out with friends, binge-watching my favorite series, or scrolling through social media to stay updated on trends.I have a creative side—I enjoy painting and sketching whenever inspiration strikes. Music is a big part of my life, whether I’m singing my favorite songs or discovering new artists to add to my playlist. I’m also a foodie who loves trying out new snacks or making late-night instant ramen while watching YouTube.In my free time, I enjoy playing with my pets, because they always know how to brighten up my day. On weekends, I might sleep in late, go for a casual walk, or spend hours gaming or reading webcomics. Life as a teenager is all about balance—studying, making memories, and figuring out who I want to be!
